            Redeemer High School was established in 1980 in the western region of Uganda, in Bundibugyo district. At the time of its establishment, Uganda was still recovering from years of political instability and conflict under the rule of Idi Amin, who had been overthrown in 1979.
            The region around Bundibugyo had been particularly affected by the conflict, with many people displaced and infrastructure damaged or destroyed. It was in this context that the idea for Redeemer High School was born.
            The school was founded by a group of local community leaders, who saw education as a way to help young people in the area rebuild their lives and contribute to the development of their communities. They were joined by a number of volunteers from other parts of Uganda and from overseas, who provided financial and other support for the school.
            In its early years, Redeemer High School faced a number of challenges, including limited resources, a lack of qualified teachers, and ongoing political instability in the region. Despite these challenges, the school persevered, and gradually grew in size and reputation.

              In the early days of Redeemer High School, the school was housed in makeshift buildings with limited resources, but the community's commitment to education was so strong that students continued to attend and learn despite the challenges.

            In the late 1990s, the school faced a new challenge when the region was hit by an outbreak of Ebola virus. The school was closed for several months, and many students and teachers were affected by the outbreak. However, the school worked with local health officials and NGOs to help contain the spread of the virus, and eventually reopened with new health and safety measures in place.

            Today, Redeemer High School remains a beacon of hope for young people in Bundibugyo and beyond. It is a testament to the power of education to transform lives, and a reminder that even in the most difficult of circumstances, communities can come together to achieve great things.
